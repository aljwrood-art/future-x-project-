                <p>Self-love is the foundation of inner peace, giving a person the strength to face life with a calm and open heart.
                     When someone truly loves themselves, they begin to understand their worth and no longer seek constant validation from others.</p>
                     <p>With this inner love grows confidence, and self-confidence can transform a person—turning fear into courage and hesitation into determination.
                      A confident person trusts their abilities, speaks with clarity, and walks through the world with purpose. To reach that level of confidence, one must practice self-respect, set small goals,
                       celebrate progress, and forgive themselves along the way</p>
